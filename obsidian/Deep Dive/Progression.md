The main way to progress in Deep Dive is through missions, known as **extractions.** Extractions come in varying challenges, sometimes multiple, that the player may redeem to get currency and materials.
## Extractions
As said before, extractions vary in challenge, and can sometimes be combined, and are entirely based on your **experience**. 
On death, experience will not be lost; however, all the items in your inventory will be **permanently gone** and can not be retrieved.
### Extraction Types
Extractions have multiple types, which are listed in this table:

| Type      | Description | Exp. Min. Req. |
| :---      |    :----   |      :----:     |
| Bounty | Kill **x** number of **y** | 0 |
| Mining Expedition | Mine **x** amount of **y** | 0 |
| Timed Mining Expedition | Mine **x** amount of **y** in **z** time | 0 |
| Timed Bounty | Kill **x** number of **y** in **z** time | 500 |
| Rescue | Rescue **x**, bring them to base | 750 |
| Timed Rescue | Rescue **x**, bring them to base in **z** time | 2000 |
| Retrieval | Retrieve **x** from **y** | 1000 |
| Zone Capture | Capture **x** zones | 1500 |
| Timed Zone Capture | Capture **x** zones in **z** time | 2000 |
| Zone Defense | Defend zone **x** for **y** time | 3000 |

## Currency
Currency is the main way to obtain new weapons and defenses, as well as some utility items. It is required that you pay said currency to be able to order new items in to be made from the materials you provide.
Currency can be obtained by doing extractions, and the results vary on the difficulty and amount of challenges within the extractions.
A fraction of currency will be lost on death, but not all.
