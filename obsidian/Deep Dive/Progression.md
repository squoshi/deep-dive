The main way to progress in Deep Dive is through missions, known as **extractions.** Extractions come in varying challenges, sometimes multiple, that the player may redeem to get currency and materials.
## Extractions
As said before, extractions vary in challenge, and can sometimes be combined, and are entirely based on your **experience**. 
On death, experience will not be lost; however, all the items in your inventory will be **permanently gone** and can not be retrieved.
### Extraction Types
Extractions have multiple types, most requiring a minimum amount of experience, which are listed in this table:

| Type      | Description | Exp. Min. Req. |
| :---      |    :----   |      :----:     |
| Bounty | Kill **x** number of **y** | 0 |
| Mining Expedition | Mine **x** amount of **y** | 0 |
| Timed Mining Expedition | Mine **x** amount of **y** in **z** time | 250 |
| Timed Bounty | Kill **x** number of **y** in **z** time | 500 |
| Rescue | Rescue **x**, bring them to base | 750 |
| Timed Rescue | Rescue **x**, bring them to base in **y** time | 2000 |
| Retrieval | Retrieve **x** from **y** | 1000 |
| Zone Capture | Capture **x** zones | 1500 |
| Timed Zone Capture | Capture **x** zones in **y** time | 2000 |
| Zone Defense | Defend zone **x** for **y** time | 3000 |

***Bounty***:
Bounties are simple missions, in that players have to kill a certain amount of a type of creature. Bounties are normally held when there are infestations in a certain area.
Infestation mobs have increased stats:
- +10% damage increase (scalable based on combined player XP)
- +20% health (non-scalable)
However, players get a slight boost in speed (5%).

***Mining Expedition***:
Mining Expeditions are another type of simple mission that requires players to obtain a certain amount of a specified material. The amount of ore required scales with XP, and with zero XP the amounts can range from 100-250 (that's around a single vein).
Players get increased XP from mining ores during a Mining Expedition.

***Rescue***:
Rescues are a mission type that require players to capture a single creature (normally a baby) and bring it home safely. Taking damage while the creature is in the capsule may damage the creature as well.
Creatures have 15% increased damage.

***Retrieval***:
Retrievals require players to retrieve an object from a creature. This includes lost parts, eggs, etc.
While a Retrieval mission is going, the creature has increased stats:
- +40% health
- +20% damage
- +15% speed

***Zone Capture***:
Zone Capture missions require the player to fend off creatures and capture a designated area successfully. The player who places the block must stand in the vicinity of the block or else the progress will lower; consequently, they must not die or let the progress go back to 0%, or the mission will fail.
While a Zone Capture mission is going, creatures have increased stats:
- +30% damage
- +20% health
- +15% speed
Zones fully captured will increase the team's gathered XP while the zone is still alive.

***Zone Defense***:
Zone Defense missions require the player to defend an already captured zone for a specific amount of time. If all players die while the mission is going, the mission will (obviously) fail and the zone will be destroyed.
Creatures will have increased stats while the mission is going:
- +40% damage
- +40% health
- +10% speed
## Currency
Currency is the main way to obtain new weapons and defenses, as well as some utility items. It is required that you pay said currency to be able to order new items in to be made from the materials you provide.
Currency can be obtained by doing extractions, and the results vary on the difficulty and amount of challenges within the extractions.
A fraction of currency will be lost on death, but not all.
