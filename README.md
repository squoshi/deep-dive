# Deep Dive

This is the official repository for the modpack Deep Dive, a full conversion Minecraft modpack inspired by the popular game Deep Rock Galactic.
## Contribution

Contribution is welcome! They are done via the use of pull requests. You can send me a DM on discord `@squoshi.` or join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/X9XfzfTDqH) to request a pull request to be committed, or wait for a comment on it. **I am not required** to pull anything.

## Setting up a developer workspace
Setting up a workspace is rather easy.

### Downloading the pack
1. Grab the latest GitHub release and import it via CurseForge or whatever your launcher needs for an exported CurseForge pack
2. Clone the repository into the modpack folder (it is ideal to use GitHub Desktop for this, or a client that can do the same)

### Setting up the Python script for ready use
The Python scripts require the pip packages `requests` and `icecream`. You can install them by running `pip install icecream` and `pip install requests` in whatever terminal you use for Python.

### Notes
Make sure to pull request any changes you make, and always run the `create_manifest.py` script with Python 3.11+ every time you update, downgrade, remove or add a mod!
